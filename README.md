Deadline Buddy

Deadline Buddy is a productivity assistant designed to help students and professionals stay consistent with their deadlines. Unlike a basic to-do list, it combines task management with session tracking and motivational reminders, making it easier to manage study/work schedules without getting overwhelmed.

Problem It Solves

Students and young professionals often:

Forget deadlines due to lack of structured reminders

Struggle to balance tasks with effective study/work sessions

Feel unmotivated when using traditional to-do apps that lack personalization

Deadline Buddy solves this by integrating task deadlines, personalized motivation, and tracked sessions in one place. This reduces deadline anxiety, keeps productivity on track, and builds a sense of progress.

Key Features

Add, update, and delete tasks with deadlines

Link study/work sessions to tasks for structured progress tracking

Cascading delete (removing a task removes linked sessions)

Motivation modes (encouraging, strict, or casual)

Exception handling for smoother user experience

Beginner-friendly yet scalable Java backend

Tech Stack

Backend: Java (Core Java, JDBC for DB operations)

Database: SQL (for tasks and sessions storage)

Frontend: Basic HTML/CSS (lightweight interface, extendable later)

Version Control: Git/GitHub

How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/deadline-buddy.git
cd deadline-buddy


Set up the database (SQL schema in /db folder).

Compile and run the Java backend:

javac Main.java
java Main


Access the app locally (via CLI or basic web interface depending on version).

Future Scope

Smart notifications (desktop/mobile/email reminders)

Analytics dashboard (time spent, productivity score)

Cloud deployment on AWS/Azure

Mobile app integration (Android/iOS)

Team collaboration features
