# Deadline Buddy

Deadline Buddy is a productivity assistant designed to help students and professionals stay consistent with their deadlines.  
Unlike a basic to-do list, it combines **task management** with **session tracking** and **motivational reminders**, making it easier to manage study/work schedules without getting overwhelmed.  

---

## 🚀 Problem It Solves  
Students and young professionals often:  
- Forget deadlines due to lack of structured reminders  
- Struggle to balance tasks with effective study/work sessions  
- Feel unmotivated when using traditional to-do apps that lack personalization  

✅ **Deadline Buddy solves this by integrating task deadlines, personalized motivation, and tracked sessions in one place.**  
This reduces deadline anxiety, keeps productivity on track, and builds a sense of progress.

## ✨ Features  
- ➕ Add, update, and delete tasks with deadlines  
- ⏱️ Link study/work sessions to tasks for structured progress tracking  
- 🗑️ Cascading delete (removing a task removes linked sessions)  
- 💡 Motivation modes (encouraging, strict, or casual)  
- ⚡ Exception handling for smoother user experience  
- 🖥️ Beginner-friendly yet scalable Java backend

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Backend:** Java (Core Java, JDBC for DB operations)  
- **Database:** SQL (for tasks and sessions storage)  
- **Frontend:** Basic HTML/CSS (lightweight interface, extendable later)  
- **Version Control:** Git/GitHub
